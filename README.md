### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis

### Description
This project analyzes bikeshare data from various cities in the United States. It allows users to filter data by city, month, and day of the week to explore different statistics such as the most frequent times of travel, the most popular stations, trip duration, and user demographics. The analysis includes:

- **Time Statistics**: Identifies the most common months, days, and hours for bike trips.
- **Station Statistics**: Determines the most popular start and end stations, as well as the most frequent trip combinations.
- **Trip Duration Statistics**: Calculates the total and average trip durations.
- **User Statistics**: Provides insights into user types, gender distribution, and birth year statistics.

The project uses Python and libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis. The datasets used are provided by Udacity and include bikeshare data for Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
